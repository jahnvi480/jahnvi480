## Welcome to my GitHub


I’m an **SDE at Microsoft** on the Azure SQL Drivers team, building the next-gen open-source Python driver (**mssql-python**) — making database connections feel effortless and developer-friendly. 🚀  
I dive into **DBAPI 2.0, Entra ID support, performance tuning, and cross-platform builds**. Before Microsoft, I was at Myntra, building full-stack solutions and winning hackathons 🏆 — learning to solve problems creatively (and quickly!).  
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me **painting 🎨, sketching ✏️, or strumming my guitar 🎸**, because creativity never takes a day off.  

### 🚀 My Open-Source Work
