## Welcome to my GitHub


I am pursuing my <img src='images/graduation-cap.png' width=100%> B.E in I.T from TSEC, Mumbai.<br>
I have created a few projects and have worked as Web Developer in 2 startup companies.<br>
I am looking for opportunities to achieve my career goals and expanding my knowledge in the field of technology. 

Besides coding I love to dance, paint, cook and watch dog posts and memes on Instagram (YES! I love dogs, pandas and other animals too).
