## Welcome to my GitHub


I am pursuing my <img src='images/graduate-cap.png'> B.E in Information Technology <img src='images/laptop.png'> from TSEC, Mumbai.<br>
I have created a few projects <img src='images/idea.png'> and have worked as Web Developer <img src='images/web-link.png'> in 2 startup companies.<br>
I am looking for opportunities to achieve my career goals <img src='images/target.png'> and expanding my knowledge in the field of technology. <img src='images/graduate-cap.png'> 

Besides coding I love to dance, paint, cook and watch dog posts and memes on Instagram (YES! I love dogs, pandas and other animals too).
